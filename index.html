      <h1>About NASA</h1>
      <p>
        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is Americaâ€™s civil
        space program and the global leader in space exploration. The agency has
        a diverse workforce of just under 18,000 civil servants, and works with
        many more U.S. contractors, academia, and international and commercial
        partners to explore, discover, and expand knowledge for the benefit of
        humanity. With an annual budget of $23.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021,
        which is less than 0.5% of the overall U.S. federal budget, NASA
        supports more than 312,000 jobs across the United States, generating
        more than $64.3 billion in total economic output (Fiscal Year 2019).

        At its 20 centers and facilities across the country and the only
        National Laboratory in space NASA studies Earth, including its climate,
        our Sun, and our solar system and beyond. We conduct research, testing,
        and development to advance aeronautics, including electric propulsion
        and supersonic flight. We develop and fund space technologies that will
        enable future exploration and benefit life on Earth.
      </p>
      <br />

        NASA also leads a Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes
        working with U.S. industry, international partners, and academia to
        develop new technology, and send science research and soon humans to
        explore the Moon on Artemis missions that will help prepare for human
        exploration of the Red Planet. In addition to those major missions, the
        agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life
        better for people worldwide. For example, companies use NASA discoveries
        and technologies to create new products for the public. To ensure future
        success for the agency and the nation, NASA also supports education
        efforts in STEM with an emphasis on increasing diversity in our future
        workforce.

        NASA is led by Administrator Bill Nelson, who became the agency's 14th
        administrator on May 3, 2021. Nelson served in the U.S. Senate for 18
        years from Florida and as a payload specialist on space shuttle mission
        61-C in 1986.

        The term "astronaut" derives from the Greek words meaning "space
        sailor," and refers to all who have been launched as crew members aboard
        NASA spacecraft bound for orbit and beyond. The term "astronaut" has
        been maintained as the title for those selected to join the NASA corps
        of astronauts who make "space sailing" their career profession.
